# Forkify Project

This application is a recipe website which allows the user to search for a food and select a recipe containing that food. It also allows the user to change the number of portions and add the recipe to your bookmarks. The recipes added to bookmarks stay in local storage to be able to view them in the future no matter if you close the page. The bookmarks can be removed if they no longer want it in their bookmarks. You can also upload your own recipe for your eyes only!

This project was part of my JavaScript course with Jonas Schmedtmann ('The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!'). The app was designed and created by him and I followed along with his extensive and indepth lectures to create it. It challenged me in many different ways. Managing all the files and understanding where each function belongs was challenging and educational. I really enjoyed seeing the app take shape and see it complete.
